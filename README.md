# How to use

0. Give yourself a `blockstateissue:issue`.
0. Plop it down.
0. Use right-click to toggle between a state with TE (diamond ore) and one without (diorite).
0. Observe the logs.
   Clearly, the TE does not get removed when switching to the other state.
0. Give yourself a `blockstateissue:removal_issue`.
0. Plop it down.
0. Use right-click to toggle between a state with TE (gold ore) and one without (stone).
0. Observe the logs.
   Now, the TE gets removed, but only on the server side, leaving a confused client.
